## b7s-toolbox

Some experiments and utilities written to test some of the b7s stuff.

This repo has a `replace` directive in the `go.mod` file, since it's typically used to test some local `b7s` code.
It's entirely possible that it doesn't compile with `b7s` code at any random point in time, since it's not kept in sync but used to test stuff on the fly.
